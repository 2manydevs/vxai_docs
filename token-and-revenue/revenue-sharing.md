# Revenue Sharing

While our platform is free to use, it charges a small fee between 0.1%-1% based on your tier holding on executed trades on DEX.&#x20;

On top of that we also offer a subscription model to have access to our auto trading bot for the non holders who would like to benefit from it. You can access our tier solution [here](tiers-system.md).

VIP/Token holders receive 50% of the fees and revenues generated thanks to our subscription model.

Revenues will be shared at the end of the month for all holders who held for the total month.
