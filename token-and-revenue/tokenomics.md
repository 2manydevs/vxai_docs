# Tokenomics

The VortexAI total supply has been set at 10,000,000,000 tokens, split amongst the liquidity, team, private investors, our bounty program, liquidity reserve, and a portion burned right from the launch.

We've carefully designed our tokenomics to ensure a smooth launch while promoting long term growth.

| Allocation               | Pourcentage | Details                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Presale                  | 20%         | 75% available at launch, 25% after 1 week  |
| Team                     | 10%         | Locked 3, 6, 9 months (3% each period)     |
| Liquidity                | 10%         | Locked 3 months at launch (extended later) |
| Partnerships & Marketing | 10%         | Locked 1 month at launch                   |
| Additional Liquidity     | 30%         | Locked 1 month at launch                   |
| Burn                     | 20%         |                                            |

All the locking periods will be extended shortly after launch once we ensure everything is running smoothly.\

\
**Private round**\
We raised $35,000 of which 50% will be used for providing liquidity on the Uniswap V2 pool. The rest will be allocated to our opened bills and development costs, marketing and a part will be dedicated to fund our VortexAI fund at launch.



**Fees**\
We apply a 5/5 tax for trading the token.\
\
The token tax is distributed between the marketing, development costs and team.

* 3% for the development costs
* 1% for LP
* 1% marketing

The Token Tax Fees are subject to change in the future.
