6\. Your API has been created! Copy and Paste both your “Key” and “API Secret”, and along with your API Passphrase you will use them to set up the exchange on your bot to link with your KuCoin Trading Account.

\*\*Note\*\*: Once you click “Confirm”, The Secret will disappear, so be sure to copy and paste on to somewhere you can leave it.&#x20;
